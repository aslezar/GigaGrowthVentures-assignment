Develop a basic webapp using MERN stack wherein a user can share the latest sales number with his/her boss by email or whatsapp.

1. Create a login using Google authentication.
2. Once the user logs in, they need to see a dashboard wherein they can fetch the stock price for the given stock on the 15th of May is **\_\_\_**(use any publicly traded stock price from NSE or BSE using any freely available API )
3. The user can share that information with their boss (another user) by email or whatsapp with the message "The stock price on the 15th of May is **\_\_\_**".
4. Implement logout functionality.

You just need to share a video screen record of the app with clear explanation in your own voice how you implemented each part.
